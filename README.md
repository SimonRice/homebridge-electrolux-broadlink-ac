# Electrolux Broadlink Airconditioner Plugin for Homebridge

For Electrolux Family ACs that use the Broadlink module internally.

## Operation

should be able to use the Gui in Homebridge to add. theres no configurable options at this point.


### note re fan speed

fan speed in apple home is a %

on these ACs there is 6 settings so it maps this way:

 0-19%  Quiet Mode
20-39% Low
40-59% Med
60-79% High
80-99% Turbo
100%   Auto


todolist:
finish this readme
maybe limit the discovery to electrolux ACs to avoid clashing with other broadlink devices



Thanks to many poeple will add that soon. DotEfekts from HA forums for the python code, and heaps of others too
